"""Tests for CHANGE_CYCLE.md — the procedure a change is expected to follow.

The cycle is a *pointer* document on purpose: it owns the order of operations
and reads its two lists (the post-sync checklist and the model audit) out of
FORK.md rather than copying them, so there is one checklist to maintain instead
of two that drift. That design has exactly one silent failure mode — a heading
in FORK.md gets renamed, every link in the cycle still renders, and the
procedure quietly points at nothing. Nothing else in the suite notices: the
markdown is valid, the tests are green, and the next agent following the cycle
lands on FORK.md's top and improvises.

`test_the_checklist_heading_is_the_one_the_sync_script_parses` is the same guard
from the other side: `scripts/upstream_sync.py` finds the checklist by that
exact heading text, so the cycle and the automated sync PR either break together
or not at all.
