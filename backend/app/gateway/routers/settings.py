"""Runtime-toggleable server settings (fork feature).

These are settings a user may flip from the Web UI at runtime — as opposed to
the operator's ``config.yaml``, which the UI never rewrites. Two things live
here:

* **multi-user mode** — per-user thread isolation, default on. Server-wide, so
  the write is admin-gated (in passwordless mode the built-in ``default`` user
  is admin).
* **chat tabs** — the per-user keep-alive tab strip. Per-user UI state, so it is
  scoped to the caller and needs no admin gate.
* **chat folders** — the sidebar's folder registry (id, name, display order).
  Also per-user UI state, and ungated for the same reason.
